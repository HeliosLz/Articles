**时代的旁观者  Spectator of the Times**

思考一下“当代艺术“这个词语意味着什么？如果你问人们他们会有不同的见解，最近我问了一些不同的人，有一个表示，当代艺术就是1950年之后的艺术；另一个人表示那这样一切不都是当代艺术了吗？他的定义是已经完成的艺术品。一般来说人们普遍会说我真的不善于表达，想不出来一个恰当的定义，也许我最喜欢的一个定义是当代艺术可以是任何事，所以我觉得我们可以看看泰特对于当代艺术的定义：泛指当今和最近的艺术，其性质是创新的或前卫的。

Think about what the term "contemporary art" means. If you ask people they will have different opinions, and recently I asked a few different people, one said that contemporary art is art after 1950; another said that everything is contemporary art then. His definition is artwork that has been completed. Generally people will generally say I'm really not good at expressing myself and can't think of a proper definition, and maybe one of my favorite definitions is that contemporary art can be anything, so I think we can look at Tate's definition of contemporary art: a general reference to present-day and recent art that is innovative or avant-garde in nature.

**当代艺术的诞生与发展  The Birth and Development of Contemporary Art**

1917年，在纽约独立艺术家协会举办的一次展览中，作为评委之一、当时已经成名的艺术家的马赛尔*杜尚将一个从商店买来男用小便池起名为《泉》，匿名送到美国独立艺术家展览要求作为艺术品展出。杜尚之所以把小便池命名为《喷泉》，除了他确实是水淋淋的外表之外，也是对艺术大师们所画的《泉》的讽刺。

In 1917, at an exhibition held by the Society of Independent Artists in New York, Marcel *Duchamp, who was one of the jurors and an established artist at the time, named a store-bought urinal for men "The Fountain" and sent it anonymously to the American Independent Artists Exhibition with a request to be exhibited as a work of art. The reason Duchamp named the urinal "Fountain" was, in addition to his truly watery appearance, a satire on the Fountain painted by the masters of the art.

此举令当时的艺术界大跌眼镜，社会上骂声一片，认为这种行为是对艺术的极大侮辱。

看到同行们的反应，杜尚终于验证了自己的预测----他明白自己的艺术观念太超前，时人无法接受。于是他退出了独立艺术家协会。

从《泉》起，"现成品艺术"成为杜尚最要的艺术观念。

杜尚提倡的一种"绝对自由"的艺术哲学，使艺术从此只为表现和证明它的亲生父母----艺术家的理念而存在。艺术的面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化，当代艺术的时代由此开始。


This move caused the art world at the time to fall on its face, and the community cursed the act as a great insult to art.

Seeing the reaction of his peers, Duchamp finally verified his prediction ---- He understood that his artistic ideas were too advanced for the people of his time to accept. So he withdrew from the Association of Independent Artists.

From "Fountain" onwards, "ready-made art" became Duchamp's most important artistic concept.

Duchamp advocated a philosophy of "absolute freedom" that made art exist only to express and prove the ideas of its biological parents ---- artists. The face of art changed radically, and the era of contemporary art began.

艺术的发展本就是一个不断推翻前人的过程：一个革命性的事物成为了这个时代的先锋，就必然会成为下个时代的保守派。经历了从原始美术到中世纪艺术、到文艺复兴开启的写实绘画时代，再到印象派、以及塞尚开创的现代主义绘画时代，传统的绘画语言在沿用旧的创作思路中也难以推陈出新；且随着社会、经济以及工业水平的发展，人们的物质水平快速提高，而精神需求也紧随其后，传统架上绘画的局限性并不能满足当下人民的精神诉求；当代艺术在这样的一个时间节点上，在杜尚手中诞生了，既是偶然的，也是必然的。

而当代艺术也在这一百多年的成长中，生长出众多繁茂的枝桠，极大地丰富了艺术家的创作途径和表现语言，使人们能找到更合适的方式来更准确、更细腻的来表达自己的作品概念。

The development of art is a process of constantly overthrowing its predecessors: a revolutionary thing that becomes the pioneer of this era is bound to become the conservative of the next. After experiencing the era of realistic painting from primitive art to medieval art, to the Renaissance, and then to Impressionism and the modernist painting era created by Cézanne, it is difficult for the traditional painting language to push forward with the old creative ideas; and with the development of social, economic and industrial levels, people's material level is rapidly increasing, and their spiritual needs are also following. The limitations of traditional easel painting could not meet the spiritual demands of the people today; it was both accidental and inevitable that contemporary art was born in Duchamp's hands at such a point in time.

In the course of more than a hundred years of growth, contemporary art has grown numerous branches, greatly enriching the creative paths and expressive languages of artists, enabling people to find more appropriate ways to express their concepts more accurately and delicately.

**学会欣赏当代艺术的乐趣与意义  Learn to appreciate the joy and meaning of contemporary art**

我希望大家可以为自己找到一件艺术品，然后尽可能长时间的观看它，人们平均只会花8秒钟看一幅画，但我想让大家享受到“慢看”的感觉，可以尝试花几分钟甚至几十分钟的时间来看一幅作品。

I want people to find a piece of art for themselves and look at it for as long as possible. People only spend an average of eight seconds looking at a painting, but I want people to enjoy the feeling of "looking slowly" and try to spend a few minutes or even a few minutes looking at a piece.

我知道这很难，因为我自己也很难做到，但是试试花几分钟来看一副作品，看看你会发现什么？

I know it's hard because I have a hard time doing it myself, but try taking a few minutes to look at a pair of pieces and see what you find?

当你开始看一副作品的时候，你会发现艺术家运用的材料，以及他们是如何运用的，所以你可能会思考他们绘画中的笔触，他们当时的心情是怎样的，他们很快完成了这件作品吗？

When you start looking at a piece of work, you notice the materials that the artist used and how they used them, so you might think about the brush strokes in their painting, what was their mood at the time, and did they finish the piece quickly?

他们的笔触是很强劲还是很平滑，涂料是厚还是薄，它的表面像什么，你可能想要看看作品的形态，看看相邻颜色间的搭配，看看艺术家做的标记，从作品中会发现一些关于艺术家自身的事情吗？你会对特定的元素所吸引吗？

Are their strokes strong or smooth, is the paint thick or thin, what does it look like on the surface, might you want to look at the form of the work, look at the matching between adjacent colors, look at the marks the artist made, will you find out something about the artist himself from the work? Would you be attracted to specific elements?

现在把目光从作品移开，是否脑海里还留存着这幅作品的元素？你能记住的越多那么你能与之产生的联结也就越多，你能从中为自己找到意义。

如何才能做到？一个小小的建议能够磨炼你的鉴赏能力，那就是想象。你可以通过和别人交流作品来促进自己的想象和思考。

Now take your eyes off the work, do you still have elements of the work in your mind? The more you can remember then the more connections you can make with it and the more meaning you can find for yourself from it.

How can you do this? One small suggestion to sharpen your appreciation is to imagine. You can facilitate your own imagination and thinking by sharing your work with others.

总之，当代艺术作品是艺术家思想和情感的载体，欣赏这些作品，就是与艺术家进行一场思想和情感的交流。通过这种交流，我们可以拓宽视野，丰富心灵，提升自己的审美情趣。

In short, contemporary art works are the carrier of the artist's thoughts and emotions, and to appreciate these works is to have an exchange of thoughts and emotions with the artist. Through this exchange, we can broaden our horizons, enrich our minds, and enhance our aesthetic sensibilities.
